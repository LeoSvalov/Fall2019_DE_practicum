# Differential equations computation practicum, Fall semester 2019, University Innopolis
The computation practicum is about representing numerical methods(Euler,  Improved Euler and Runge-Kutta methods) of solving differential equations.
- With the given differential equation, there were an analyzing and plotting graphs of all numerical methods. The detailed analysis of code and interface  you can see in the report(**DE_PracticumReport.pdf**).
- For plotting graphs, library **matplotlib** was used.
-  For creature of the interface, library **Tkinter** was used.
